INSTALL

1. Directory and file structure
   This software has the following structure
   / <- the user’s account, could be for example /home/cuisine
   /logs <- where the system logs are stored
   --/operaciones <- where the operations logs are stored
   --/sql <- where the sql operations are stored 
   /conf <- where the configurations are stored
   /public_html <- where the web pages are
   --/photos <- where product and categories photos are uploaded
     --/v1 <- where the version pages are located
       --/admin <- where the admin system is located
       --/resto <- where the user view is located
   /resources <- where installation files and other resources external to the main system are located

2. Installation
   Please be sure to copy the complete file structure to your user directory.
   You will need to configure manually the routes to the configuration files
   and set permissions on the logs and photos directories.

2.1 Configure directory permissions
    Please be sure that the web user can write to the logs and photos directories.
    Simple you can assign the following “all access” permissions to both directories
      chmod 777 /home/cuisine/logs
      chmod 777 /home/cuisine/public_html/photos

2.2 Database creation
    Now, let’s crate a data base and load the initial information to the system
    In mySQL or MariaDB, lets create a user that has all access to a data base:
    In the following example, we will create the database "cuisine", the user "cuisine"
    (password will be cu1s1n3) and will later grant full access to this user to the data base created.
      create if not exists database cuisine;
      grant all privileges on cuisine.* to cuisine@localhost identified by 'cu1s1n3';
      flush privileges
    Now, we will load the initial configuration to the data base.
    The initial configuration is found in the file “initial-db.sql” inside the resources directory:
      mysql -u cuisine -p cuisine < initial-db.sql
    please use the password when prompted.
    This will load an initial configuration needed to use the system.

2.3 Configure the system for use
    Inside the /conf directory you will find two sample configuration files.
    One for the main admin system and the other for the user view (resto).
    First, copy the two sample files to the definitive filenames:
      cp sample.admin.conf.phpinc admin.conf.phpinc
      cp sample.resto.conf.phpinc resto.conf.phpinc
    Edit the two files, which are separated to reflect the system name, language and most important, 
    the database information.
 
2.4 Initial user
    The initial admin user is “admin” with password “admin” without quotes.

2.5 Initial access
    In your browser, access http://yourhost/youruser/v1/admin/
    The user view is available at http://yourhost/youruser/v1/resto/

2.6 Enjoy!
