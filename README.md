# La Cuisine
“La cuisine” (The kitchen) is a PHP based web system for small restaurants, food fountains and pubs.

It offers two separated and (even) separated interfaces, and administrative (with user roles and access levels) and a normal user view.
The administrative interface offers the chance to create product categories, products inside categories, photos for categories and products, prices and daily menus that will be offered for reservations. Of course, you can generate sales reports based on categories, products and/or dates. Depending on your user level access you can also administer users in the system.

The normal user view is set for visitors, who want to see what dishes are available, photos and prices. Also, if the visit is under the permitted times, the visitor is allowed to make a reservation for dishes available in the daily menu. The reservation must be confirmed via a code that is sent via E-Mail.

Hope you enjoy this small system, suggestions and comments are always welcomed.
